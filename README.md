Students, Especially fresh ones, generally struggle to move and navigate through the
university, finding their classes and other places, even non-fresh students may be unfamiliar
with some places, especially when the University area is relatively large, so our application
features an outdoor navigation system on the map, as well as indoor navigation using QR
codes in each floor, that tells students where to go based on which class they wanna get to.
Another annoying thin could be the Cafeteria and the lack of online ordering, students may
want to eat between lectures, where there is a 10 min break, they won’t be able to wait for
long, so we implemented a cafeteria system where restaurants register themselves, and get
ready to receive, update and notify user’s orders, while having Paypal payment option, or on
receipt.
Finding a suitable dormitory can be a challenging task, so we allowed for dormitory owners
to post their dormitories, including information like distance from campus, rooms, rent and
other necessary information, so students can filter posts to find a suitable dormitory.
We also allowed users to post items they wanna sell or trade, and other students interact
with their posts by reserving them and chatting to reach an agreement.
